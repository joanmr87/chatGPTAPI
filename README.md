# Chat GPT in just 30 seconds!

In this repository, you'll find a simple Node.js script that demonstrates how to use the OpenAI Chat GPT API to generate natural language responses for your applications. With just a few lines of code, you can tap into the power of artificial intelligence and create chatbots, language translation tools, and more.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Once you have these dependencies installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` (or your preferred package manager)
3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the repository with the following line: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
4. Run the script with `npm start`

That's it! You should see the response from the Chat GPT API printed to your console.

## Usage

Feel free to modify and customize the `chat()` function to fit your specific use case. You can experiment with different prompts, message roles, and API parameters to create a wide range of natural language responses.
